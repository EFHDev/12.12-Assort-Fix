# 12.12-Assort-Fix
lol yeah

This fixes (Most of) the missing items in ragfair (fleamarket) and crafting issues caused by this missing assort code,

If you find something still missing @ me in the jet discord or open a Issue (or pull request? i dont know how github works)

HOW TO INSTALL:

Download from release page,

Open the .RAR, 

Drag and drop both folders inside the rar into the base folder (where server.exe is) 

Click "Ok" When asked if you want to overwrite existing files

Delete read-me.txt
